# Form notification settings
# Note: To receive email notifications for form submissions, you have two options:
#
# Option 1: Configure in Netlify Dashboard (Recommended for simple setups)
#   1. Go to Site settings > Forms > Form notifications
#   2. Add an "Email notification" for the "booking-request" form
#   3. Enter your email address to receive notifications
#
# Option 2: Use the submission-created function with an email service
#   Set these environment variables in Netlify Dashboard:
#   - NOTIFICATION_EMAIL: Your email address to receive notifications
#   - EMAIL_API_KEY: API key for your email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
#   - EMAIL_API_URL: API endpoint for your email service
